# DIP-TASK-02
Write a Python program using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform basic digital image processing operations on a given color image.
The program should load and display the original RGB image, extract and display the Red, Green, and Blue color components separately.
convert the image into grayscale, and then generate a binary image using thresholding.
Further, apply connected component analysis on the binary image to detect and count the number of objects present. Finally, display the binary image and the connected component labeled image with randomly assigned colors for each object.
